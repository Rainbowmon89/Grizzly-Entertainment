# Grizzly-Entertainment
Grizzly's Entertainment is a stage equipment business that offers the rental of equipment 
for events requiring staging, lighting, power, and sound. The managers of the company 
are currently facing an issue scheduling the equipment for all the events for the upcoming 
Jamaican Christmas holiday season. You are hired to create software that will assist the 
company in the management and scheduling of their assets.
Design a JAVA application that will meet the requirements. Your application should be 
built using the Client/Server architecture. Your Database should be located on 
the server machine where the client will make requests to the server over the network.
Your client applications must send requests to the server application as only the server
application can establish connections to the database. The server will process the 
corresponding request from the client. Your application should be developed with a 
graphical user interface that will aid the users of the system in their respective data 
entry and processing. Please include a GUI to interact with the data for all 
database tables. The server application need not have a GUI. However, you may include 
graphical components to enhance user experience
